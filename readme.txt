1. First, install Guest Additions for Drag and Drop compatibility.
2. Turn on Drag and Drop, Make it "Host To Guest" or "Bidirectional"
3. Turn on Shared Clipboard ("Host To Guest" or "Bidirectional")
4. Make a new .txt File and Paste the code from ClippyGenerator.vbs
5. Change the file extension of the .txt to .vbs
6. Open File Explorer and go to the path: C:\WINDOWS\msagent\chars
7. Download the .zip file format from https://archive.org/details/clippitMS
8. Drag and Drop the file CLIPPIT.ACS that is in the .zip file to the path stated in step 6.
9. Run the .vbs file and configure your dialog.
10. Click OK on all  screens after typing what animation you want him to do and what you want him to say (leave blank for none)
11. On  the final "Run Dialogue" Screen, Click OK.
Congrats! Clippy now does what you want him to do
